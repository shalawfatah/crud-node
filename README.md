# CRUD - NODE
- This is the backend of a note-taking app using Javascript
- I used React in the frontend (& Tailwind) and NodeJS (Express) in the backend.
- I used MongodDB and Mongoose Library to update the database
- This is a custom full-stack app, no additional CMSs or libraries are used to make the operations easier.
- This is a project that I build to learn any new framework, as it covers a lot in terms of what is expected of what developers do with the language.
